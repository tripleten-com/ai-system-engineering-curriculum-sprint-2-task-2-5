# Coldline Task 2.5 — API and idempotency path

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/tripleten-com/ai-system-engineering-curriculum-sprint-2-task-2-5/tree/main)

## Start the system

Prerequisites are Python 3.12 and Docker with Compose v2. The supplied bootstrap supports macOS
arm64/x86-64, Windows x86-64, and Linux x86-64/aarch64, and installs pinned uv 0.11.8 under
`.tools/bin`. If your computer cannot run the stack locally, use the Codespaces button above.

On macOS and most Linux distributions the interpreter is `python3`; substitute it wherever these
commands say `python`.

```shell
python infra/scripts/bootstrap.py
./.tools/bin/uv sync --frozen
./.tools/bin/uv run --frozen poe preflight
./.tools/bin/uv run --frozen poe start
./.tools/bin/uv run --frozen poe ready
./.tools/bin/uv run --frozen poe ingest
./.tools/bin/uv run --frozen poe baseline
```

PowerShell and POSIX wrappers are available under `infra/scripts/`. After uv is on `PATH`, the
shorter `uv run --frozen poe <task>` form works.

| Service | Local URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| API | `http://localhost:8000` | Submit exception workflows and retrieval queries |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` | Use the focused diagnostics dashboard |
| Prometheus | `http://localhost:9090` | Query bounded metrics |
| Jaeger | `http://localhost:16686` | Inspect local traces |
| LocalStack S3 | `http://localhost:4566` | Inspect the emulated object-storage endpoint |

Each of these ports can be overridden by setting the matching `COLDLINE_API_HOST_PORT`,
`COLDLINE_GRAFANA_HOST_PORT`, `COLDLINE_PROMETHEUS_HOST_PORT`, `COLDLINE_JAEGER_HOST_PORT`, or
`COLDLINE_LOCALSTACK_HOST_PORT` environment variable in your shell environment or a local `.env`
file (copy `.env.example`) if a default collides with something already running on your machine.
Keep the override in place for every `poe` command.

If you change the API port, also set `COLDLINE_API_HOST_PORT` in the shell that runs
`poe load-test`: this command does not read `.env`. Use the same port for startup and load testing.
For example, to use port 8001, run the command for your shell before starting the system:

| Shell | Set the API host port |
|---|---|
| PowerShell | `$env:COLDLINE_API_HOST_PORT = "8001"` |
| macOS/Linux (POSIX) | `export COLDLINE_API_HOST_PORT=8001` |

PostgreSQL, Redis, worker metrics, and OTLP remain inside the Compose network. Codespaces uses the
same `compose.yaml` and keeps every forwarded port private.

## Command path

For a fresh investigation, run the supplied commands in this order:

```text
poe start
poe ready
poe ingest
poe baseline
poe verify
```

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `poe ingest` | Run the supplied baseline corpus ingestion inside the API container |
| `poe baseline` | Run every published query and print the baseline evaluation report |
| `poe versioning` | Run this Task's versioning and idempotency checks |
| `poe student-tests` | Run your own tests under `tests/student/` |
| `poe unit` | Run fast isolated behavior tests |
| `poe contract` | Check interfaces, boundaries, submissions, and repository structure |
| `poe smoke` | Check the initialized running platform |
| `poe e2e` | Run the external API-to-worker workflow |
| `poe verify` | Run the public student verification path |
| `poe scenario` | Run the supplied exception-workflow walkthrough |
| `poe load-test` | Run this repository's supplied traffic profile |
| `poe reset-baseline` | Clear exception and Redis data, then restart the worker between load runs |
| `poe restart` | Restart the existing API and worker containers **without rebuilding**; run `poe start` instead after editing source |
| `poe stop` | Remove containers and the network, keeping named volumes |
| `poe reset` | Remove containers, the network, and local named volumes |

`poe ingest` is idempotent: running it twice produces the same rows, the same counts, and the same
corpus digest. `poe reset` removes the database volume, so run `poe ingest` again after a reset.

For Task 2.5, `poe verify` rebuilds and starts the stack, ingests the supplied corpus, then runs
readiness, smoke tests, the end-to-end exception workflow, the answer-sheet checks, the
versioning and idempotency checks, and your own tests under `tests/student/`.

`poe verify` begins with `poe start`, which is `up --build --wait`. Your router runs inside the
API container, so the containers the checks talk to have to be built from your checkout rather
than from a previous one.

## Overview

Use the Task 2.5 lesson to decide what to do. This README covers local setup and repository
orientation.

1. `README.md` — local setup, commands, and permitted changes.
2. [`docs/student/task-2-5-contract.md`](docs/student/task-2-5-contract.md) — the two supported
   operations, their published contracts, and where each check looks.
3. `src/api/v2_contracts.py` — the evolved request and response shapes, supplied.
4. `src/api/idempotency.py` — the supplied handler you apply, and the order it enforces.
5. `src/domain/idempotency.py` — the claim contract and why claim precedes the write.
6. `src/api/extensions/api_v2.py` — the file you implement.
7. `src/api/extensions/wiring.py` — where you return your router.

The application source lives in five flat packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `api` | HTTP delivery, API use cases, the retrieval workflow, student wiring, configuration, and composition |
| `worker` | Background processing, retries, configuration, and composition |
| `domain` | Provider-neutral contracts, state rules, identity, redaction, embedding, chunking, fusion, access constraints, service and repository contracts |
| `ports` | Exactly five visible application interfaces |
| `adapters` | PostgreSQL, pgvector retrieval, Redis Streams, S3-compatible object storage, deterministic model, logs, traces |

`src/api/bootstrap.py` and `src/worker/bootstrap.py` compose each process from its settings and
adapters. Process settings live in `src/api/config.py` and `src/worker/config.py`; other modules
receive settings or collaborators through function and constructor arguments.

## The five ports

Find the available interfaces in `src/ports/`. A port describes an application capability; an
adapter provides it using a concrete technology. Determine which ports are active from your own
runtime evidence rather than from this guide.

| Port | General responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ModelProvider` | Call an AI model service |
| `Retriever` | Look up relevant context or documents |
| `ObjectStore` | Store large binary objects or files |
| `JobQueue` | Publish and consume background work |
| `SecretProvider` | Read API keys and credentials |

## Document API

The document surface and the repository behind it are supplied from this Task onward.

```text
POST /api/v1/documents                        -> persist one document and its chunks atomically
GET  /api/v1/documents?tenant_id=&clearance=  -> list the documents one scope may read
GET  /api/v1/documents/{id}?tenant_id=&clearance=         -> one document, or 404 when out of scope
GET  /api/v1/documents/{id}/chunks?tenant_id=&clearance=  -> that document's readable chunks
```

The reference data layer from Task 2.3 is composed for you here.

## Versioned API

Version 1 is supplied and stays exactly as it is. Version 2 is what you add.

```text
POST /api/v2/documents   DocumentV2Request  -> DocumentV2Response   (documents_v2_create)
POST /api/v2/readings    ReadingV2Request   -> ReadingV2Response    (readings_v2_accept)
```

Build exactly one of them. Each requires an `Idempotency-Key` request header; a repeated request
with the same key returns the stored response and carries `Idempotency-Replayed: true`.

## Retrieval API

Both endpoints are supplied and are not student work.

```text
POST /api/v1/retrieval/search
  {"query_id": "...", "text": "...",
   "authorization": {"tenant_id": "...", "clearance": "standard"},
   "explain": false}
  -> ranked results, per-stage evidence, prompt context, citations

GET  /api/v1/corpus/objects?prefix=corpus/
  -> the object keys visible through the published ObjectStore port
```

Set `"explain": true` to add the authorization stage's readable pool to the evidence. That costs
one extra query, so ordinary requests leave it off.

## Test levels

| Level | Requires Compose | Main question |
|---|---:|---|
| Unit | No | Does one responsibility behave correctly, including failures? |
| Contract | Some | Do interfaces, schemas, paths, and dependency rules stay compatible? |
| Smoke | Yes | Did the complete local platform initialize and become observable? |
| E2E | Yes | Can an external client complete the supplied workflow? |

Contract checks marked `runtime` need the running stack. `poe contract` skips them; `poe verify`
and `poe runtime-contract` run them.

## Submission checks

Run `poe verify` locally before opening your student pull request. Public GitHub CI repeats
the student checks. The course platform (CMS) runs the required protected grading separately
and associates its results with your submission commit. A green template-export check, or a
skipped student check on an `export/` branch, is not a passing grade. You do not configure
GitHub grading secrets. Follow the Task lesson's instructor-review and progression policy.

## Task boundary

Task 2.5 asks you to extend **exactly one** supported operation into a version 2 endpoint and to
protect that one write path with the supplied idempotency mechanism. Both choices are equally
valid and both pass when implemented correctly.

The evolved contracts are supplied in `src/api/v2_contracts.py`, and the idempotency handler is
supplied in `src/api/idempotency.py`. You build the route and apply the handler; you do not invent
a schema and you do not build a locking or caching engine.

These paths are student-editable:

- `src/api/extensions/api_v2.py`
- `src/api/extensions/wiring.py`
- anything else you add under `src/api/extensions/`
- anything you add under `tests/student/`
- `submission.yaml`

`src/api/routes.py`, `src/api/idempotency.py`, `src/api/v2_contracts.py`, and
`src/domain/idempotency.py` are protected. You add a version rather than editing the existing
routes — the v1 contracts are checked for exactly that. Read
[`docs/student/task-2-5-contract.md`](docs/student/task-2-5-contract.md) for each operation's
contract and where each check looks.

The supplied defaults are `top_k = 3` and `dense_weight = 0.5`. Each arm returns a fixed
candidate pool of 12 rows before fusion, so the two parameters change what fusion selects without
changing what the arms see.

### Student walkthrough

See **Task 2.5: API and idempotency path** in your course platform for the full walkthrough. In
outline: start the stack and ingest the corpus, read the two published v2 contracts and the
supplied idempotency handler, choose one operation and record it, build its router in
`src/api/extensions/api_v2.py`, return it from `build_v2_router`, confirm the v1 routes still
answer unchanged, run `poe versioning` and then `poe verify`, and open your pull request.

## Operational limits

This local system does not authenticate users, terminate TLS, or manage production secrets.
A retrieval request states its own tenancy and clearance, so that context is an asserted
identity rather than a verified one. The Compose PostgreSQL password and the LocalStack access keys
are local-only non-secret credentials. Never place real credentials, personal data, or production
records in this repository, including in `infra/corpus/`.

Named volumes preserve local PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger state across
`poe stop`. LocalStack object contents are deliberately not persisted; the initializer re-uploads
the supplied corpus artifacts on every start. The `poe reset` command deletes the named volumes.
This topology makes no backup, replication, high-availability, disaster-recovery, capacity,
latency-SLO, or availability claim.

See [JobQueue fidelity](docs/fidelity/JobQueue.md),
[ModelProvider fidelity](docs/fidelity/ModelProvider.md),
[ObjectStore fidelity](docs/fidelity/ObjectStore.md), and
[Retriever fidelity](docs/fidelity/Retriever.md) for the active adapter boundaries. The
[local runtime evidence](docs/fidelity/local-runtime.md) records the current measurement and its
qualification limits.
